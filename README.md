# React Portfolio
Professional Porfolio

## Description

This project is a one-page upd-to-date portfolio! The main page renders an About Me, with a quick blurb on who I am and I do.  The Contact Me is a contact form that allows users to reach out to the developer.  The Projects link brings the user to a list of previous work.  Finally, the resume section renders a current resume for potential employers.

This portfolio increased my ability to build applications using React.  I learned how to work with the MUI library and further enhanced my knowledge of css styling.  While there is plenty of more styling to do, I learned a lot more about how to utilize state in an application and I hope to work more and cultivate a further understanding of React.  

## Installation

If the user desired, they could download the app and then run `npm start`.  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
